## Dataset
We first collect a dataset from Software Assurance Reference Dataset
(SARD) ( https://samate.nist.gov/SRD/index.php) which is a project maintained by National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) (https://www.nist.gov/). SARD contains a large
number of production, synthetic, and academic security flaws or vulnerabilities (i.e., bad functions) and many good functions. In our
paper, we focus on detecting vulnerability in C/C++, therefore, we
only select functions written in C/C++ in SARD. Data obtained
from SARD consists of 12,303 vulnerable functions and 21,057
non-vulnerable functions. 

For real-world dataset, we are grateful to the share of DanielLin (*"Deep learning-based vulnerable function detection: A benchmark"*). 
If you'd like to download the data, you can make a request to him (https://github.com/DanielLin1986/Function-level-Vulnerability-Detection).
